Some vagrant boxes to demonstrate the power of automated deployment

	* Vagrant Basic - Start a vanilla ubuntu 12.04 VM.
	* Vagrant Provision - Start an Ubuntu 12.04 VM and run a provisioning script to install a java JRE.
	* Vagrant Advanced  - Start two Ubuntu 12.04 VM's, setup a private network and run provisioning scripts to install nginx on one and mongodb on the other.  They should be able to ping each other once built.
	* Vagrant Puppet - Start an Ubuntu 12.04 VM, run provisioning scripts to install latest version of puppet and execute puppet to deploy SSH and java.
